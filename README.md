Welcome to this github repository. This repo aims to help beginner to get started with Python and navigate through some of the Python fundamental concepts in a structural manner.

## Python Interpreter
In order to run or compile python code, your computer needs to have python interpreter installed. 

**For Windows**
* Go to app store and simply search for python, choose one of latest version. 

**For other OS**
* I'm sure you can navigate installing python on your own. If not ask Mr. Google.

Note: Newer versions of Python are generally better, but might run into error if used to compile codes written from other version of Python. 

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
IDE or code editors are applications where programmer can effiently write codes, execute command line, debug and etc in a single space. 

IDE comes in many flavors, some popular ones are:
1. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>  (Personal Favorite)
2. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>
3. <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>
4. <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a> (Perfect for data explorations)


If you are new to programming and might just wanna try many things, <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda<a> is a platform that provides most tools (including Python, VSCode, PyCharm, etc) you need in a single installation. 
    
    
## Road Map For Learning
Self help notebooks are organized according to days where each day covers a few core concepts. The easiest way to run these notebooks is by using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google's Colab<a>. On the main page, select GitHub and enter the url of this repository. From there, you can choose the relevant Day folder and open the notebook via Colab.
